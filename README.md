OVERVEIW OF THE PROJECT
Overview
This project is a Weather Forecast Dashboard built using Python. It fetches real-time weather data for a specified city from the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizes temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends over time using matplotlib and seaborn. The project demonstrates how to work with APIs, handle JSON responses, and create meaningful data visualizations.

Key Attributes
API Integration: Utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch 5-day weather forecasts in 3-hour intervals for a specific city.
Data Parsing and Handling:
Parses JSON responses to extract relevant information like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and timestamps.
Handles potential API errors gracefully with error-checking mechanisms.
Data Visualization:
Uses matplotlib and seaborn to plot temperature, humidity, and wind speed trends over time.
Employs a clean, user-friendly layout with multiple subplots for a dashboard-like experience.
DataFrame Usage:
Converts the extracted data into a pandas DataFrame for easier handling and visualization.
User-Centric Design:
Ensures x-axis labels are readable by auto-formatting timestamps.
Provides actionable feedback when API requests fail or when data is unavailable.
Objectives
Demonstrate API Usage:

Illustrate how to send requests to APIs, handle responses, and process JSON data for practical applications.
Enhance Data Visualization Skills:

Showcase how to use matplotlib and seaborn to create aesthetically pleasing and informative plots.
Provide Real-Time Insights:

Offer users a clear and concise view of weather trends to help with planning and decision-making.
Build a Reusable Framework:

Create a modular and reusable codebase that can be easily adapted for other cities or data sources.
Promote Learning and Collaboration:

Encourage users to learn about API integration, data handling, and visualization by providing well-documented, open-source code
